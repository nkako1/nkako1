                    Here’s how it works: clients send their data to LiveRamp, which is sanitized and matched before being sent out to the client’s end platform. Until recently, the only way for a client to know where their data was in the process and how close it was to being delivered was to sign into our platform Connect periodically and check to see if a status symbol in a table had changed. 
                    <br><br>
                    Client feedback from personally conducted user interviews and filtered back from our operations team overwhelmingly reported that this current state was cumbersome, time consuming, and often inaccurate.

                <p class="case-study-section-body">
                    A PM creates a new notification in our internal admin app and specifies the intended audience, the type of notification (error, status, etc.), and the content for the in-app and email notifications.
                    <br><br>
                    The PM’s team calls the notification service and passes back any variables that may be used in the notification content, e.g. the name of the file or the reason why it failed.
                    <br><br>
                    The PM enables the notification in our internal app, scopes it only to him/her and tests. This was part of the intended design: that a PM could enable a notification in production and test it in a real environment, but only he/she would be able to see it. This way, we could monitor real-life elements of the user experience before release, like how an email was displayed for certain stricter email clients or what kind of volume a user of a given persona would receive in a week.
                    <br><br>
                    That’s it! Once the notification is enabled and scoped to all users, every Connect user has the ability to subscribe to this new notification and choose to receive in-app and/or email communication.

                    Hear me out. Our operations team has very close relationships with our biggest clients, sometimes so much as to speak to them daily. Building the notifications system was part of a company-wide effort to move towards self-service and automation. But it’s not particularly fun being told you now have to do something that your account manager has always done for you. For this reason, a couple larger clients I spoke with couldn’t see the value of receiving notifications that alerted them to a poorly formatted file or to an action required for a workflow. However, internal research had yielded an estimate of 20 hrs saved a week across the operations team, so:<br><br>
                    Cost of building in engineering hours + approx. hours of client onboarding*% of client base over a certain ACV<br>
                    _________________________________________________________________<br>
                    Time savings across operations team<br><br>
                    Approaching it this way, I estimated we would pay back the hours in under two months. And so it was a go!

                    Back in startup days, LiveRamp’s product was purely a backend system that the operations team manipulated to service their clients. Soon after I joined, a new objective was announced: self-service SaSS. We would take our platform Connect, which was then one page and read-only, and transform it into a standalone, self-service UI through which a user could complete any task currently performed by their account team. Previously, any UI work had been done completely ad hoc: all architecture, organization, and styling was done at the engineer’s discretion.

                    I teamed up with a full-stack engineer and together we mapped out a plan to create a reusable library of React components. 
                    <br><br>
                    We divided and conquered. I set about determining what components to include based on Connect’s functionality at the time and what we were currently building. I also did research and incorporated ideas from other toolkits and style guides. My partner architected the project and did the heavy lifting by building most of the components. At this stage we also opened it up to the rest of the full-stack team, circulating the list of components to be built and requirements for each.
                    <br><br>
                    For each component, either built by my partner or submitted by the team, I would step in later to style each component, QA it, and add it to our display page. I created global variables for colors, shading, and hover interactions so they would easy to tweak later.

                    Once our components were built and the display page was complete, we did a final round of documentation for the toolkit. My partner published the npm package and our team was able to use it right away!

                    Kodos, as it is called for its green tinge, has enabled full-stack development at LiveRamp to explode. Full-stack developers can now put together a new page in minutes by stacking toolkit components like Legos, when previously they had to create every input, button, and table from scratch.

                    Open Source is Not Always the Answer<br><br>
                    When we built the toolkit, our contributing team was 5 engineers. We all sat in the same bank of desks, so communication was extremely easy. As our full-stack team grew, more and more was lost in translation and our best practices eroded. Our open-source model allowed engineers across the organization to contribute, driving up complexity and limiting the effectiveness of the components by making them too flexible. Now we have to commit time and resources towards simplifying a few key components. If we were to do it all over again, I would have more explicit best practices around what functionality should be added directly to a component (hover patterns, onclick events) and what should be abstracted as a utility (applying colors or allowing an input to accept and parse a comma-separated string).

                    Historically clients would transfer data files to LiveRamp via SFTP, which would then be parsed and mapped manually by the operations team. These files contain identifiers (email addresses, postal addresses, etc.) that we must recognize and flag. This is so the system can match this row of data to an anonymized person and so we are absolutely sure we are not sending through any sensitive or personally identifiable information.

                    To Assume Makes a ...Sump Out of Me<br><br>
                    For this project, it was easy to make assumptions based on what I already knew of our system. A couple times, I had to check myself and reset to a user’s state of mind. I developed some fun methods for doing this, including physically relocating away from the engineering part of the office, talking with a friend in Sales for 5 minutes, or reading a few client emails. I developed a pretty good sense of when I was getting too in the weeds and practiced returning to a user’s state of mind with and without help. As someone who likes to dive into technical problems, this resetting practice will be very useful for me going forward.
